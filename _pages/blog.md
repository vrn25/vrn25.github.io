I find blogs a great way to learn new things and to strengthen the concepts. Following are the links to posts that I wrote while learning various topics based on my understanding:

## [Survey on Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Reinforcement Learning](https://aarl-ieee-nitk.github.io/reinforcement-learning,/adversarial/attacks,/defense/mechanisms/2020/04/09/Survey-on-Adversarial-attacks-and-defenses.html)

## [Proximal Policy Optmization](https://aarl-ieee-nitk.github.io/reinforcement-learning,/policy-gradient-methods,/sampled-learning,/optimization/theory/2020/03/25/Proximal-Policy-Optimization.html)

## [Trust Region Policy Optimization](https://aarl-ieee-nitk.github.io/reinforcement-learning,/policy-gradient-methods,/sampled-learning,/optimization/theory/2020/03/12/Trust-Region-Policy-Optimization.html)
