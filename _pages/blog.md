I find blogs a great way to learn new things and to strengthen the concepts. Following are the links to posts that I wrote while learning various topics based on my understanding:

## [Survey on Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/aarl-ieee-nitk/aarl-ieee-nitk.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2020-04-09-Survey-on-Adversarial-attacks-and-defenses.md)

## [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://github.com/aarl-ieee-nitk/aarl-ieee-nitk.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2020-03-25-Proximal-Policy-Optimization.md)

## [Trust Region Policy Optimization](https://github.com/aarl-ieee-nitk/aarl-ieee-nitk.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2020-03-12-Trust-Region-Policy-Optimization.md)

## [Temporal Difference Learning](https://github.com/aarl-ieee-nitk/aarl-ieee-nitk.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2019-12-19-Temporal-Difference-Learning.md)
