I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and AI. My goal is to develop robust autonomous artificial agents with cognitive abilities to interact, coordinate, and negotiate. I am particularly interested in the following domains:

* Developing provably convergent and efficient algorithms for sequential decision making in mixed cooperative-competitive multi-agent environments that learn with teammates' and opponents' awareness.

* Conjuction of machine learning and robotics (Robot learning). Particularly in deep reinforcement learning (especially model-based RL, unsupervised (meta-) RL).

* Adversarial learning to improve the Conditional Variance at Risk (CVaR), that is, the worst-case performance of the system.

* Algorithms to achieve Sim2Real transfer with minimal degradation of performance.
