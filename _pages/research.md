I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and AI. My goal is to develop robust autonomous artificial agents with cognitive abilities to interact, coordinate, and negotiate. I am particularly interested in the following domains:

* Developing efficient algorithms for sequential decision making in mixed cooperative-competitive multi-agent environments that learn with teammates' and opponents' awareness.

* Conjunction of machine learning and robotics (Robot learning). Particularly using deep reinforcement learning and model-based optimization for robotics.

* Developing algorithms for adversarial learning to improve the Conditional Variance at Risk (CVaR) and achieve Sim2Real transfer with minimal degradation of performance.

* Unsupervised reinforcement learning and meta-learning.
