Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/), IIT Madras, India, under the supervision of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Aravind Rajeswaran](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aravraj/), working on multi-agent reinforcement learning and robust control to develop interactive policies that are robust to changing environment dynamics and adversarial perturbations.
