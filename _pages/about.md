I am third year undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka ([NITK](https://www.nitk.ac.in/)) Surathkal, Mangalore, India. Currently, I am interning at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/), IIT Madras, India, under the supervision of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/), where I am working on multi-agent reinforcement learning and robust control to develop interactive policies that are robust to changing environment dynamics and adversarial perturbations.
