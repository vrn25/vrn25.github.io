I am third year undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka ([NITK](https://www.nitk.ac.in/)) Surathkal, Mangalore, India. Currently, I am a research intern at Purdue, working with [Prof. Kamyar Azizzadenesheli](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/kamyar/) and [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) on a novel framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning in turn-based games. Before this, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/), IIT Madras, India, under the supervision of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) on interactive optimization algorithms in multi-agent reinforcement learning.
