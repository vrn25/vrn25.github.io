This is an ongoing project under the [IEEE NITK](https://github.com/IEEE-NITK) Computer Society. In this project, we aim to develop and improve multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms that enable interactive, collaborative, and negotiating behaviors in the mixed cooperative-competitive many-player games.

More on this project - under construction, coming soon!!
